/**
 * Every astronaut in the colony, drawn in a dozen instanced draws.
 *
 * The body is one instanced, GPU-skinned mesh playing KayKit's hand-animated clips (see
 * `crew.js`) — every torso, arm and leg in the colony in a single draw, whether there are
 * six threads or three hundred. Everything the crew *wears* stays procedural and stays in
 * its own `InstancedMesh`: helmet, visor, screen-face, backpack, antenna and lamp, because
 * those carry the colony's own identity and its own shaders.
 *
 * The body and the three parts on the head exist twice: a fine set for builders near the
 * camera and a coarse one for everybody else — see `LOD_NEAR`. Same materials, same bone
 * table, same shaders; only the triangle count differs, and it differs by a factor of
 * five, which on an integrated GPU was the difference between the crowd being the most
 * expensive thing in the frame and being one of the cheapest.
 *
 * Worn parts are pinned to bones the cheap way. The baked animation lives in an ordinary
 * array as well as in the texture the shader samples, so placing a helmet is one matrix
 * read out of that array — no skeleton is evaluated on the CPU, and the helmet can never
 * be a frame out of step with the head it sits on.
 *
 * Per-agent variation that would normally need a separate material rides along as instanced
 * attributes instead: suit colour and eye colour through `instanceColor`, the face's atlas
 * frame and the body's animation frame through custom `aFrame` attributes.
 *
 * Picking is done analytically rather than by raycasting the instanced meshes — projecting
 * N head positions to screen space is both cheaper and far more forgiving to click at the
 * size these characters render.
